## What is EduLabs ?
###### EduLabs is an __interactive educational app__ which allows students to access their personal labs and helps them carry
###### out practicals in times like these when online education is the major medium of education.

## Inspiration 
###### The online medium has taken over the education industry. The students face difficulty in getting access to the 
###### laboratory education. There are many simulation softwares which make the work easy but none get them as far as 
###### giving them a real-life experience. So, we propose EduLabs as an alternative to the online laboratory education.

## What does EduLabs do?
###### EduLabs empowers the students to visualize the laboratory education through an immersive Augmented Reality(AR)
###### experience. Students can learn at their pace at the comfort of their homes. All this is made possible through 
###### a mobile application without any additional burden.

## How We built it
###### Our Team built EduLabs using  :
<ul>
  <li> <b>Unity</b> </li>
  <li> <b>Google ARCore </b> </li>
  <li> <b>C# </b></li>
  <li> <b>Java</b></li>
</ul>

## Challenges We ran into
###### Creating an immersive experience 

## Accomplishments that I'm proud of
###### Creating a fully functional Augmented Reality app in a short span of time

## What I learned
###### Implementing Lean Touch, Virtual Buttons and other features in AR.

## What's next for "EduLabs"
###### 1. Creating a web portal for teacher where they can check the progress of their students in EduLabs.
###### 2. Scaling up our application so that millions of students across the world can be benefitted.

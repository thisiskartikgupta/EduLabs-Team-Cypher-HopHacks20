## What is EduLabs ?
###### EduLabs is an __interactive educational app__ which allows students to access their personal labs and helps them carry
###### out practicals in times like these when online education is the major medium of education.

## Inspiration 
###### The online medium has taken over the education industry. The students face difficulty in getting access to the 
###### laboratory education. There are many simulation softwares which make the work easy but none get them as far as 
###### giving them a real-life experience. So, we propose EduLabs as an alternative to the laboratory education.

## What does EduLabs do?
###### EduLabs empowers both the teacher as well as the students to visualize the laboratory education through an immersive
###### Augmented Reality(AR) experience. 

## How We built it
###### Our Team built EduLabs using  :
<ul>
  <li> <b>Unity</b> </li>
  <li> <b>Google ARCore </b> </li>
  <li> <b>C# </b></li>
  <li> <b>Java</b></li>
</ul>

## Challenges We ran into
Lean Touch

## Accomplishments that I'm proud of
Pta ni

## What I learned
How to code, react, etc.

## What's next for "EduLabs"
I hope some hackers learn how to write good Devpost submissions
